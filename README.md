VEML6035 is a 16-bit low power, high sensitivity CMOS
ambient light sensor operated via a simple I2C command.
The sensor offers an active interruption feature that is
triggered outside of the threshold window settings
eliminating loading on the host. Active average power
consumption is around 300 μW.
VEML6035 incorporates a photodiode, amplifiers, and
analog / digital circuits in a single chip. Vishay’s patented
FiltronTM technology, a wafer level optical filter, provides
the best spectral sensitivity to match human eye responses.
The sensor has excellent temperature compensation to
maintain output stability under changing temperature and its
refresh rate setting does not need an external RC low pass
filter. There is a programmable shutdown mode which
reduces current consumption to 0.5 μA. Operating voltage
ranges from 1.7 V to 3.6 V.
